## Inspiration üí°

One of the most significant challenges that all organizations face is the issue of unconscious bias in their hiring processes. Hiring managers may unconsciously allow their own beliefs and perceptions to influence their decisions in picking candidates. These biases, rooted in social conditioning and stereotypes, can act as a **barrier to hiring qualified diverse candidates**.

Unintentional biases in applications can lead to a lack of diversity, which is especially problematic in fields like healthcare, where a diverse workforce can provide better patient care due to a deeper understanding and relatability to the patient's experience.

To address this issue, we propose: the implementation of a blind recruitment strategy. It allows candidates to present themselves without the need to conceal their identities and enables companies to focus on the skills and qualifications that are directly relevant to the job.

## What it does ü§î

DiverisifAI is a mobile app that allows job seekers to apply for jobs anonymously while emphasizing more in their talent. Applicants upload their resume and our platform uses GPT-4 to tweaks signs of identity‚Äîrace, age, gender, religion, etc‚Äîin their application. Applicants can then edit this new resume and use it to apply to different roles. This equalizes the playing field for applicants, and allows recruiters make fair and unbiased hiring decisions.

Our second feature is an interview preparation feature for applicants. It includes an interview bot that is knowledgeable about the job description and provides feedback and practice questions to help applicants prepare for interviews. This is particularly useful for professions such as healthcare, where interviews often include complex scenario-based questions based on ethics and medical situations.

## How we built it ‚öôÔ∏è

First and foremost, it is Crafted with üíô. We have built a ML-enabled full-stack application that solves a real world problem. The whole process can be broken into the following points :-

  
* Front-end: TypeScript, Next.js with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI

* Middleware & Backend: Express, Prisma Client, Firebase, Google Cloud API & MongoDB.

* ML Stack: PDF Parser, GPT-4

  
  ## Most Creative Use of GitHub üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

We used github to collaborate and create this project in multiple ways:

*  **Collaboration with Pull Requests and Issues:** We were a team of four members. Therefore, we created detailed **Pull Requests** to collaborate over this project. Moreover, all the bugs/features were dealt using **Issues**. We also requested **Reviews** on the PRs so that the changes could not break the product.

*  **Collaboration with Project:** Recently, we came accross Github Projects. For this hack, we utilized Github Projects to keep a track of each one's progress. We created different sections: ToDo, In Progress, Under Review, Finished and Video for the perfect team collaboration. You can check our Project [View 1 ¬∑ DiversifAI (github.com)](https://github.com/users/Gaurang-1402/projects/4)

*  **Github Wiki:** We also used the Github Wiki to explain how to setup the project locally. You can check the wiki [Home ¬∑ Gaurang-1402/DiversifAI Wiki (github.com)](https://github.com/Gaurang-1402/DiversifAI/wiki)


* **Github Workflows:** As a bonus, we also used Github workflows to assign labels to the PR to make the repository more readable.

*  **Github Templates:** The Pull Requests and Issues already have a template. Just try to raise an issue, you will be prompted to choose between two options: Feature/Bug. The templates are created using yaml file. Apart from that, we have also added MIT License and the ReadMe file.

## Design üé®

We were heavily inspired by the revised version of **Double-Diamond** design process, which not only includes visual design, but a full-fledged research cycle in which you must discover and define your problem before tackling your solution & then finally deploy it.

  

![Double Diamond](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48355572/222963483-a7b27bd8-6223-4d6a-b56d-c3570ab5f92e.png)

  

> 1. **Discover**: a deep dive into the problem we are trying to solve.

> 2. **Define**: synthesizing the information from the discovery phase into a problem definition.

> 3. **Develop**: think up solutions to the problem.

> 4. **Deliver**: pick the best solution and build that.

  

We used Figma, Photoshop & Illustrator to prototype our designs before doing any coding. Through this, we are able to get iterative feedback so that we spend less time re-writing code.

## Research üìö

Below is a list of resources that we found insightful during our ideation phase:

Northwestern sociologists find discrimination in North America and Europe has changed very little, Feb 2023 (https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2023/02/hiring-discrimination-the-problem-that-wont-go-away/)

Hiring managers pass over ‚Äònames associated with Black people‚Äô in their rush to review resumes, according to study of all 50 U.S. states, Sept 2023 (https://fortune.com/2023/09/24/affirmative-action-race-discrimination-hiring-black-sounding-names-study/)

This is a global issue - ‚ÄúTrends in racial and ethnic discrimination in hiring in six Western countries‚Äù, Dec 2022 (https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2212875120)

Nearly 20% of workers have changed their name on a resume because of discrimination concerns, says new report, Oct 2023 (https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/19/nearly-20percent-of-job-candidates-have-changed-their-names-on-resumes-because-of-discrimination-concerns)

Who Discriminates in Hiring? A New Study Can Tell, July 2021 (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/business/economy/hiring-racial-discrimination.html)

- In-depth research into AI fairness and bias is crucial to ensure our algorithms promote equality. [AI Fairness and Bias](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05842.pdf)

- It is important to acknowledge the potential for AI to inadvertently lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, and to actively work to prevent such issues. [AI and Discrimination](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2304/2304.07683.pdf)

Through our research, we discovered that even new AI technologies can contain biases depending on their training data. To mitigate this, we propose utilizing our AI as a neutralizing intermediary instead of having it act directly as a hirer.

## Challenges we ran into üò§

We faced some challenges during the hackathon, many of which ironically related to working remotely. One of the major challenges was the time difference. All of us participated from different time zones, which created communication challenges. 

We were also very ambitious and spent hours trying to implement Adobe PDF Extract API (as it can also give you the formatting/styles of the resume), but we didn't have enough time to implement access tokens and Adobe's in-house cloud uploading, so we turned to a simpler PDF parsing API.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of ‚ú®

We are proud of finishing the project on time which seemed like a tough task as we started working on it quite late due to other commitments. We were also able to add most of the features that we envisioned for the app during ideation. And as always, working overnight was pretty fun! :)

  
This project was a notable accomplishment for us because it presented a unique experience compared to the typical hybrid hackathons. We engaged in thorough brainstorming and extensive research, which culminated in a satisfying sense of accomplishment upon successfully completing the project.

  

## What we learned üôå

**Proper sleep is very important! :p** Well, a lot of things, both summed up in technical & non-technical sides. Also not to mention, we enhanced our googling and Stackoverflow searching skill during the hackathon :)
